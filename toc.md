title: Table of Contents Block
---

When you create a Table of contents it will display

![Table of Contents empty block](assets/img/toc-empty.png)

You can change the "Contents" text to whatever you want for the table of contents heading, or leave it as the default.

Headings with HTML anchors will be automatically added to the table of contents. The anchor can be set in the block settings under Advanced (to open up settings click the settings icon in the top right, or `Ctrl+Shift+,`). Anchors cannot contain spaces, so if you have a heading for "Individual Registration" then the anchor should be `Individual-Registration`, or you could shorten it to `Registration`. Just make sure you don't have duplicate anchors on a page.

The anchor is used to generate an internal link like `#Registration` which is used not only in the table of contents, but can also be directly linked to from another page e.g. `https://www.southlacrosse.org.uk/club-responsibilities#Registration`.

Once you have headings with anchors the table of contents will look something like:

If headings are nested, e.g H2 then H3, then the H3s in the table of contents will also be indented.
