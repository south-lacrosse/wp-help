Clubs are added using their own post type, and can be found on the main WordPress Admin Dashboard.

They are edited in the same way as regular pages and posts, however the club's location should be added using a [Location Block](location.md), as that will correctly format the Google Map, and make sure the club is placed correctly on the Clubs Map etc.

You should also use the [Attribute Value Block](attribute-value.md) to correctly format things like contacts, club colours etc.

When you create a new club you will be presented with a template for how a club should be set up. You can easily delete any unwanted blocks by using the List View.

Links to the club's website links should contain the text "website" or "Facebook" (case doesn't matter), possibly proceeded by "Club ", as these will be what is displayed on the Clubs List page.

To create links highlight the text for the link, click the link icon, and add the URL.

You should check out the layout for other Clubs to see what is possible.
