## Content Width

By default the content width is limited to 720px. This is because text is difficult to read if the lines are too wide. There is also a wide alignment of 1024px, and you can use this for blocks which support this (Image, Table, Media & Text, Column, .etc), however keep in mind the readability of the page.

Some blocks also support full width, but this should be used extremely sparingly.

## Post Author

You should be aware that posts (not pages or clubs) will display the author name and modified date on the front end, so if you create a post from an account for your role such as "SEMLA Webmaster" it will display that name. If you want the post to display your actual name then you should create the post from a personal account (or see below to create a post as a different user). Note in the above example this doesn't mean setting the "SEMLA Webmaster" name to your name, as when someone else takes over that role the name will be changed, and all the posts that user has authored will have the author name changed too! If you need a personal account then you should ask the Webmaster or another administrator to create one for you.

### Creating Posts As A Different User

If you user account has the Editor or SEMLA Officer roles (and they most likely do) you can assign posts to a different author, either while editing it from the Post Settings, or you can change existing posts from the Posts list screen using Quick Edit or Bulk actions.
