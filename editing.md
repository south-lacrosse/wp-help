## Content Width

By default the content width is limited to 720px. This is because text is difficult to read if the lines are too wide. There is also a wide alignment of 1024px, and you can use this for blocks which support this (Image, Table, Media & Text, Column, .etc), however keep in mind the readability of the page.

Some blocks also support full width, but this should be used extremely sparingly.
